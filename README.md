# InsurTech Industry

## Overview and Origin

### Name of company
Lemonade Inc

### Date of Incorporation and Founders ###

Lemonade was founded in New York in April 2015 by Shai Wininger (current COO) and Daniel Schreiber (current CEO), both vetrans in the tech industry.

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? ###

Schreiber and Wininger recognised that insurance had been relatively untouched by technology for over a century and that it was controlled by large companies plagued by slow and cumbersome methods for creating and paying on policies, that were subject to fraud, conflicts of interest and a lack of transparency. 
These were the areas to be addressed by Lemonade using emerging technology with a focus on "social good".

### How is the company funded adn how much funding have they received? ##

Lemonade secured $13 million in seed money from Sequoia Capital and Aleph in December 2015. In August 2016, a further $13 million in funding from XL Innovate was secured, followed by a $34 million Series B funding round in December 2016.

On December 19, 2017, US$120 million was secured in a Series C funding round led by the SoftBank Group, with participation from existing investors. In April 2019, Lemonade announced a further US$300 million investment in a Series D financing led by SoftBank Group, increasing the total money raised by the company to US$480 million.

 Lemonade completed its Initial Public Offering in July 2020. Initially the company had a Market Capitalisation of some US$4.3 billion and today is US$5.86 billion, having reached a high of US$9.8 billion in January 2021: possibly suggesting that investors may be hesitant about Lemonade's ability to continue disrupt the insurance market in the future.


## Business Activities:

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

The InsurTech industry in general uses technology innovations  to create cost savings and efficiencies from the current insurance industry model, across the full range of insurance sectors. That is, disrupting an industry inflicted by high cost of insurance premiums and slow returns, by increasing the ease and speed of joining and ease of payouts, thereby creating a better user/customer experience.

Lemonade Inc. offers renters' insurance, homeowners' insurance, and pet insurance policies in the United States as well as contents and liability policies in Germany, The Netherlands, and France. 

Lemonade works with no physical branches or human hands-on interaction because it offers very standardized rates for all of its customers through a robotic system. Simplifying this process lowers overhead costs, allowing Lemonade to make money even if its database is not yet up to the level with traditional insurance underwriters

### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Lemonade offers renters', homeowners', contents and pet insurance, as well as contents and liability policies. 

Lemonade has been able to grow  rapidly because it targets young renters, whom are traditionally not the focus of insurance companies, but are comfortable with new technology. Positively, many customers who purchased low cost products from Lemonade have started purchasing higher cost insurance due to satisfaction with their experience. 

Homeowners insurance in the USA is often required as a condition of a motgage and considered a valuable asset. As such, up to 85% of homeowners in the USA have homeowners insurance. This is a sugnificant market volume but the challenge for Lemonade is to influence (middle-aged) homeowners who have already been with their legacy provider for a long period and enjoy their human interaction to move to an online option.

Globally, InsurTech continues to grow at 5% annually but with a significant focus on health. In the Property (and Casuality) market that Lemonade competes, the industry grew at a similar rate of circa 5% over the last five years and is also expected to report stable growth going forward. However, in this sector, Motor and liability lines delivered the highest growth of up to 6 percent p.a.with fire and property registering the lowest growth among all lines at 3.9 percent annually. Motor is expected to remain the largest line of business for overall growth.

Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia/Pacific countries recorded high growth in excess of 10% in the last 5 yeRS while North America, Europe, and Africa recorded minimal to zero growth.

Grand View Research stated that in 2020 the global insurtech market size was valued at USD 2.72 billion and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 48.8% from 2021 to 2028. The increasing need for digitization of insurance services is expected to propel the market growth. 

In 2019 Delloites stated that nearly two-thirds of total InsurTech investments went into the personal lines space.

Simplification of the claims processes is anticipated to drive the growth. Insurance companies are focusing on improving communication with their clients and capabilities to implement automation processes. 

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?

Lemonade products are powered by Machine Learning, ChatBots, Big Data, AI and behavioral economics; the study of psychology as it relates to the economic decision-making processes of individuals and institutions. 

It is an unconflicted business model that has a strong social element, where leftover premiums are donated to charities of customers choicee.It is simple and transparent; fees are flat, payment of claims are fast, and Lemonade give back what’s left to causes their customers care about. 

Lower fixed costs give Lemonade a pricing edge over traditional insurers where branches and human representatives for older insurers have increasingly become a cost burden instead of a benefit. Lemonade devoped a business model to better align with consumer needs, wants, and behaviors. 

The driver is that thousands of pieces of data and multiple artificial intelligence (AI) "bots" to offer quick policies, every new customer sharpens Insurtech algorithms and makes models more competitive. So while new customers mean increased potential for growing revenue and positive earnings, it also mean a higher-quality experience for existing customers.

However, in the FinTech space, Lemonade do not use any technology unavailable to competitors, but were an early mover in the InsurTech industry creating momentum with a social conscience.

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?

Lemonade issues insurance policies, using big data to predict risks and quantify losses by placing  customers in a risk group,thereby quoting a relevant premium. Machine Learning/AI efficiently handles the task of agents, improves premium pricing and underwrite customer risk as well as handling claims thereby crearting an improved customer experience. Further, purchasinga a premium is fast and through a ChatBot facility. 

These groups of “uniform insurers” share similar risk behaviours and are compiled by AI algorithms that gather extensive customer data and monitor loss ratios (“ratio of claims paid by an insurer to premiums earned”). The more data accumulates, the more recursive risk patterns emerge enabling more precise assessments.

In claims settlement, Lemonade’s AI assesses the claim by cross-referencing home information, compares it to the customer’s policy, runs fraud algorithms, and finally approves or rejects a claim in a matter of minutes.

## Landscape:

### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

InsurTech

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

FinTech companies have only emerged in the insurance space over the last 10 years and investments have grown substantially: US$140 million in 2011, US$270 million in 2013, to over $4 billion in 2020. 

The USA was the pioneering market for Insurtech but now only 46 percent of the companies are headquartered in the region with 40 percent based in EMEA. Asia-Pacific region accounts for only 14 percent of the insurtechs but is expected to be the fastest growing region in the coming years. 

Insurtechs are active in all major insurance products and business lines, with concentrations in the P&C business.

The principal technologies used include Big Data and AI. Big Data, or data analytics specifically, has been fundamental in changing the way underwriting and pricing is determined. Insurers are taking advantage of big data to apply diagnostic and predictive analytics to predict the behaviour of potential policyholders and take action based on the outcomes.

Distributions and sales also benefit due to the capability to better target and understand consumer behaviour. Claims handling and complaints are also being streamlined using Big Data.
 
AI systems have  have been able to learn, adapt and operate in dynamic and uncertain environments, assisting in taking over from the human workforce, in particular policy offerings and claims handling 
to match the needs and financial situation of potential policy holders. 

Ubiquitous data communications and digitisation have enabled market players to build global supply chains. The capability of the insurtech businesses to drive innovation in the insurance industry by developing new products and solutions will help insurance firms meet the dynamic customer requirements. 

### What are the other major companies in this domain?

The market is characterised by the presence of a large number of small players across all insurance sectors. These predominantly focus on innovations that offer unique solutions to improve the insurance value chain. 

Lemonade were rated as 4th in Fintech magazine 2020 Top 10 InsurTech companies and were the one of two companies in the group focussed on home based insurance; Neos, a London based insurer being the other. Other prominent players operating in the Insurtech market include: 
•	Acko General Insurance
•	Damco Group
•	DXC Technology Company
•	Insurance Technology Services
•	Majesco
•	Neos
•	Oscar Insurance
•	Quantemplate
•	Slice
•	Shift Technology
•	Trōv, Inc.
•	Wipro Limited
•	Zhongan Insurance

## Results:


### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Lemonade are using customer sign up as a KPI and after 5 years announced its 1 millionth customer; something that took established  insurance companies in the USA decades to accomplish.

As customer count increases and the algorithms for policy prices improve, it is expected that Lemonade's loss ratio should improve. Previously in excess of 100%, i.e.  the average aggregate of how much of a policy gets paid out being more than incomings. A loss ration under 100% is profitable and Lemondae has recently had a gross loss ratio of 72%, 7 percentage points lower than 2019 and competitive with the top 20 insurance companies. 

Key performance indicators in the insurance industry are retention, combined ratios and customer satisfaction, which require years of data to correctly assess. Nevertheless improving Loss Ratio, increased customers and increasing number of customers upgrading policies suggests customer satisfaction metrics are attractive. 

### Company Performance relative to competitors in the same domain?

As one of the first companies in the domain, Lemonade has captured  more customers than any other InsurTech company in the areas they operate, even challenging the long established players. They have attracted a young demographic who are comfortable with evolving technology (mobiles, Apps, Robotics etc) and seek a faster, simpler and more transparent way of obtaining insurance; homeowners and renters insurance powered by artificial intelligence and behavioural economics. In 2016, Lemonade claimed to set a world record for the fastest claim handled in three seconds. 

They have also been market leaders in creating a positive social benefit through their not-for-profit business model in which profits are donated to charities of customer choice. This is also appealing to a younger generation dedicated to making a positive impact on society and the community.

Accenture have stated that the digital ecosystems are having an impact on the insurance industry, with Lemonade being a leader in the rise of disruptive insurtech enterprises. While the number of InsurTech start-ups has decreased in the last year, investment and acquisition activity has continued to surge for established InsurTech companies.

As the domain has changed in recent years, new InsurTechs have begun to come to the fore to lead in specific parts of the market, whether in certain lines of business or in the use of particular technologies. For eg, Concirrus, a UK based company founded in 2011 is now considered the forerunner in behavioural-based analytics. This is a challenge to Lemonade.


## Recommendations:

### Future products or services and why these would benefit the company?

Strategically, Lemonade’s future growth is most likely to be driven by an increase in the markets they operate and potentially the delivery of specific insurance  policies related to the P&C sector.

Lemonade currently operates in a limited number of available markets. For e.g, in circa half of the US states as well as Germany, The Netherlands, and France. This provides lots of room to expand and gain greater market share in global growth areas (see above on competitive landscape). It also does business in between its various types of insurance and available growth markets. Standardising current offerings across all markets will also provide opportunities for growth.

Despite its claims that they have a large database  with which to mine, Lemonade do not have the data of the larger established companies.  Therefore, with the use of innovative techniques that have disrupted the insurance market and made them a competitive threat, it also creates a potentially valuable opportunity for partnering. AI could also be introduced into the internal systems of larger insurers to harness the very large databases that is being collected to support the data analytic process. This would improve the efficiency of processing data and making decisions in terms of contracting, claims processing and tailoring policy offerings to match the financial and personal situation of a demographically diverse range. Potentially creating Demographic- demographically-focused products. In addition, the insight gained from this data may assist in addressing fraudulent claims using AI, as many startups in recent years have been dogged by questions of automation and AI to separate fraudulent claims from genuine ones.

Conversely, for large multinational insurance companies, partnering with an InsurTech company like Lemonade whose technology offer to cut expenses, improve customer experience, and bolster their top and bottom lines, is an attractive proposition rather than trying to reinvent the wheel. Such a collaboration between old-world incumbents and innovator such as Lemonade, as is occurring in the banking sector, could be very attractive to Lemonade – notwithstanding the need to address their social values. 

With the outbreak of Covid in 2020, many companies/individuals have had to adapt to the new work-from-home model. This means that more people will spend more time at home and likely with more expensive equipment in their households. As a Home based insurer this would provide Lemonade with the opportunity to broaden their working model to include security insurance and possibly a link to workplace HSE rules with corporations – either as a single entity or on collaboration with an incumbent insurer familiar with this space.

One area may be in Telematics at home. For example , the most widely known form of telematics insurance is used in automobile insurance – black boxes installed in motor vehicles or  by using an app on a smartphone used to track driving speed, braking, acceleration, cornering and the time of the day a journey is made via satellite technology. The data is transmitted to the insurer by GPS which enables the insurer to estimate the likelihood of a claim being made while assisting in the ability of AI to more accurately assess a persons risk profile. Applying this technology to home security products and linking to home and renter insurance would provide an increased service to all Lemonade customers in this new work-from-home world. 

Note that International Data Corporation reports that on a compound annual growth basis, between 2015 and 2020 insurers increased spending on cognitive computing by 40 percent in automated claims processing, 36 percent in threat intelligence and prevention systems, 47 percent for program advisors and recommendation systems, and 49 percent in fraud analysis and investigation.

### Technologies required for the additional products/services and why they are appropriate

In general, the above strategic proposals do not necessarily require the development of new technologies for Lemonade but by entering larger markets the data in which their AI algerithms work could increase exponentially and therefore assist in refinement to better profile a broader range of customers and offer more tailoered solutions.

By entering the security service/device market and poosibly work place HSE related services is likely to require greater use of blockchain technology for safer tracking of records etc. Blockchain technology is enabling insurance companies to cut down operational costs and drive operational efficiencies. This technology can be used to drive growth and integrate varied insurtech platforms. The technology delivers efficiencies, which in turn enable new services to come to market, particularly for those who could not access insurance previously.

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Personalistaion of products and services

BLockChain and Contracts (especially where the personal and workspace comingle)

COVID-19 is anticipated to have a positive impact on the market. Numerous insurance companies are reconsidering their long-term strategies and short-term needs. The COVID-19 and its impacts are accelerating the implementation of online platforms and new mobile applications to meet consumer needs. However, privacy concerns and data security are expected to hamper the market growth over the forecast period.

The cloud computing segment led the market and accounted for more than 24.0% share of the global revenue in 2020. Cloud computing has transformed the insurance industry with its resourcefulness, ease of deployment, and flexibility capabilities. The widespread acceptance of bring your own device (BYOD) policies coupled with the growing amount of data insurance companies collect are expected to drive the cloud computing segment growth. Insurance companies are adopting cloud computing solutions owing to various benefits it offers, such as rapid deployment, cost-effective, and highly scalable, among others.
